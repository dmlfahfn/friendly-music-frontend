Two users have tested my application in two different stages. 
Both users in different ages, women. The first stage has been 
to test how they use liking music, music list, design, quality and userflow.
This stage vas during early development.

Stage 1, woman 1 (53 years):
- Found the design, (previously white background with shadow) 
more "clean" and extremly simple. "Not much to it!"
- Music list was extremly small and lacked veraity 
- Liked the like button but wanted the text to change after the status
- Userflow was driven by the design for her rather her chosing her steps.
- Quality was ok, functions worked

Stage 1, woman 2 (28 years):
- Found the first design very simple yet clean, but does not give
a music application vibe. Looked more like a book.
- Small music list, prefer more choices.
- Preferred to have her own list of liked songs first, and then
the choice to browse more music.
- Quality was simple and worked. Button text didn't work.

My understanding and reflections after Stage 1 testing:
- Design needs to be improved in order to be more eye catching.
- I need to add more music choices i order to create and attractive
application.
- There has to be more functions, i.e. more things to do for the
user before the user gets tired of the application.

Second stage was done when the developer reached done definition
of all the issues during the project.

Stage 2, woman 1 (53 years):
- Design is dark, but not too bad.
- More music choices since playlist has been added.
- Used the application more freely, because of the previous 
familiarity. 
- Button changed the text during certain stages.
- Wanted to see a list of music liked by friends, and not everyone

Stage 2, woman 2 (28 years):
- Liked the design more then the previous one.
- Liked more choices of music, preferred to have a function to 
like the playlist as well. 
- Still preferred to have her own list of liked songs first, and then
the choice to browse more music.
- Quality of liking music was good and friends was good. 

My understanding and reflections after Stage 2 testing:
- Although all the feedback is right and I agree with it,
but due to lack of time, since I started the project 
(3 weeks late due to personal reasons and sickness), couldn't reach
and make these changes after the feedback.
