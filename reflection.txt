### Friendly Music

The idea of this application was created from the love I have from
music. I wanted people to knwo what music I like, wanted to 
inspire others and get inspired when I felt like listening to
something new. 

The first three weeks didn't go as I planned. Due to some personal
reasons I couldn't work with the project almost at all, and I got
sick during that time as well. 

When I started the project I knew that there was a lot to do and I
might not reach the level of qaulity in the application as I wanted.
Therefore I decided to keep a simple design of the application and
divided the work according to the time.

I used github projects as a tool to keep track of all the work that
needs to bee done, what Iäm doing and what has been done, i.e. completed.
I had in total 8 issues which I kept track of using github pages. 

I used scrum methodoly to keep moving with the project. Every friday 
I had a retrospective where I went throught how much has been done
and what to accomplish next week. Every day I had daily scrums 
with myself were I went through what I need to do today.

Due to lack of time, I didn't reach the project goal I had in
my mind and I realised this during the first 3 weeks and when I started.
But I have tried and made simple done deifintions of user stories ´.
In short, project still does what the project planning says
apart from showing music list of friends.
